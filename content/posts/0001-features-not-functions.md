## Nobody is Taught How to Test

As we learn the trade of building software for industry, we are (hopefully)
taught that one of the key aspects of being a software engineer is to test the
code you write.  Yet there is very little instruction given around _how_ we
should write tests.

For the most part, exposure will be limited to one or two classes requiring unit
tests as part of the work submitted, or comments on pull requests asking with
various levels of politeness to not reduce the code coverage percentage.  Folks
really do like their green banners, tho, so I can't blame them.
