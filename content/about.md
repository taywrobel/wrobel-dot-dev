# What is this?

It's a blog.  I figured that was obvious, yet here we are in the about section.
As for the person behind the blog, my name is Taylor, and my favorite part about
building software is breaking it.

I've been a software engineer since graduating in 2013, and currently work at
Apple building test infrastructure.
