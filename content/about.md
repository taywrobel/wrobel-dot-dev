# What is this?

It's an online blog.  I figured that was obvious, yet here we are looking at the "about" section.

As for the person behind the blog, my name is Taylor, and my favorite part about building software is breaking it.

I've been a programmer since graduating in with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2013.  I've worked at [Palantir]
(https://www.palantir.com) as a simulation software engineer, took a detour through the startup world for a few years,
and currently work at [Apple](https://www.apple.com) building test infrastructure.
