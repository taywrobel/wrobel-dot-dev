            <description>Nobody is Taught How to Test As we learn the trade of building software for industry, we are (hopefully) taught that one of the key aspects of being a software engineer is to test the code you write. Yet there is very little instruction given around how we should write tests.
For the most part, exposure will be limited to one or two classes requiring unit tests as part of the work submitted, or comments on pull requests asking with various levels of politeness to not reduce the code coverage percentage.</description>

<p>As we learn the trade of building software for industry, we are (hopefully)
taught that one of the key aspects of being a software engineer is to test the
code you write.  Yet there is very little instruction given around <em>how</em> we
should write tests.</p>

<p>For the most part, exposure will be limited to one or two classes requiring unit
tests as part of the work submitted, or comments on pull requests asking with
various levels of politeness to not reduce the code coverage percentage.  Folks
really do like their green banners, tho, so I can&rsquo;t blame them.</p>
