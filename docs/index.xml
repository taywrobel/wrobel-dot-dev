      <description>What is this? It&amp;rsquo;s an online blog. I figured that was obvious, yet here we are looking at the &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; section.
As for the person behind the blog, my name is Taylor, and my favorite part about building software is breaking it.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a programmer since graduating in with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2013. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at Palantir as a simulation software engineer, took a detour through the startup world for a few years, and currently work at Apple building test infrastructure.</description>
