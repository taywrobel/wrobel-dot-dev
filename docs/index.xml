      <description>Nobody is Taught How to Test As we learn the trade of building software for industry, we are (hopefully) taught that one of the key aspects of being a software engineer is to test the code you write. Yet there is very little instruction given in academia and industry alike around how to write tests.
For the most part, exposure will be limited to one or two classes requiring unit tests, or comments on pull requests asking with various levels of politeness to not reduce the code coverage percentage.</description>

      <description>What is this? It&amp;rsquo;s a blog. I figured that was obvious, yet here we are in the about section. As for the person behind the blog, my name is Taylor, and my favorite part about building software is breaking it.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a software engineer since graduating in 2013, and currently work at Apple building test infrastructure.
